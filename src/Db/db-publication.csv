Dynamic Management of Identity Federations using Blockchain.,2021,conference,"Alom, I., Eshita, R. M, Harun, A. I., Ferdous, M. S., Shuhan, M. K. B., Chowdhury, M. J. M., Rahman, M. S",Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc) sponsored conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (ICBC),https://msferdous.info/DynaSAMLPersonal.pdf,"Federated Identity Management (FIM) is a model of identity management in which different trusted organizations can provide secure online services to their uses. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is one of the widely-used technologies for FIM. However, a SAML-based FIM has two significant issues: the metadata (a crucial component in SAML) has security issues, and federation management is hard to scale. The concept of dynamic identity federation has been introduced, enabling previously unknown entities to join in a new federation facilitating inter-organization service provisioning to address federation management’s scalability issue. However, the existing dynamic federation approaches have security issues concerning confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and transparency. In this paper, we present the idea of facilitating dynamic identity federations utilizing blockchain technology to improve the existing approaches’ security issues. We demonstrate its architecture based on a rigorous threat model and requirement analysis. We also discuss its implementation details, current protocol flows and analyze its performance to underline its applicability"
A Cross-Layer Trust-based Consensus Protocol for Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Using Fuzzy Logic.,2021,journal,"Chowdhury, M. J. M., Usman, M., Ferdous, M. S., Chowdhury, N., Harun, A. I., Jannat, U. S. and Biswas, K.",IEEE Internet of Things Journal (Q1),https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9372308/,"Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading platforms are being actively designed, tested, and operated by engineers, power distribution companies, and prosumers. The assurance of the accountability of the conduct of different stakeholders through a robust trust management mechanism is imperative in such platforms. The usage of blockchain, as an underlying technology, can ensure numerous properties, such as immutability, transparency, and traceable execution of transactions, in addition to ensuring trust establishment among different entities of the system. Few blockchain-based decentralized energy trading platforms have been designed in the literature to build trust about the platform and among prosumers. However, none of these proposals have considered human-in-the-loop in the trust establishment process. Moreover, these solutions have considered trust only at a particular layer of the blockchain, such as at the application or consensus layer. To bridge this gap, this article presents a novel cross-layer trust-based consensus protocol that considers human-in-the-loop and employs fuzzy logic to address the issue of vagueness of trust values by offering human interpretable trust level. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed protocol in comparison to established consensus mechanisms. The analysis also shows the protocol is immune against selfish mining, 51% and Sybil attacks."

The sky-rocket anticipation of its potential has caused a wide-scale exploration of its usage in different application domains. This has resulted in a plethora of blockchain systems for various purposes. However, many of these blockchain systems suffer from serious shortcomings related to their performance and security, which need to be addressed before any wide-scale adoption can be achieved. A crucial component of any blockchain system is its underlying consensus algorithm, which determines its performance and security in many ways. Therefore, to address the limitations of different blockchain systems, several existing as well novel consensus algorithms have been........"

In the last decade, metaverse as a concept and technology found its place among crucial enablers for technology and digital advancement across several engineering domains. Metaverse has the potential to combine the elements from distributed computing platforms, the digital evolution of physical systems, and advanced learning systems to unearth a fully digitized world of comparative properties of the real world. We should ensure the privacy, integrity, and confidentiality of personal data. These requirements will lead to proper identity management in the metaverse. Given the complex nature of the metaverse, traditional centralized systems may not offer a viable identity management solution. Therefore, this study explores a decentralized identity management system called the Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) as a logical alternative to traditional centralized identity management systems. The proposed holistic framework aims to ignite new ideas and discussions related to the combined deployment of DLT, SSI, and metaverse to inspire new implementation areas within the Industry 4.0 environment. The paper also discusses various opportunities, enablers, technical \& privacy aspects, legislation requirements, and other barriers related to SSI implementation."

The utilisation of an identifier (e.g. username, email address and so on) and credential (e.g. password) still remains the most widely deployed user authentication process, even though such an authentication process is one of the major sources of security breaches. Moreover, in this traditional setting, the management and sharing of user identity information is cumbersome with limited user controls over their identity data. In recent times, SSI has emerged as a new mechanism for managing and exchanging identity information in a more user-centric and privacy-friendly way. There are many explorations of SSI in different application domains, however, its utility for the web mostly remains unexplored. In this work, we present SSI4Web, a framework for integrating Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) for providing web services in a secure passwordless manner with much more user control and greater flexibility. We provide its architecture, discuss its implementation details, sketch out its use-case with an analysis of its advantages and limitations."

S.","Blockchain Technology in e-Healthcare Management, Chap. 4, pp. 89-125, IET,",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10329,"Health insurance plays a significant role in ensuring quality healthcare. In response to the escalating costs of the medical industry, the demand for health insurance is
soaring. Additionally, those with health insurance are more likely to receive preventative care than those without health insurance. However, from granting health insurance to delivering services to insured individuals, the health insurance industry faces numerous obstacles. Fraudulent actions, false claims, a lack of transparency and data privacy, reliance on human effort and dishonesty from consumers, healthcare professionals, or even the insurer party itself, are the most common and
important hurdles towards success. Given these constraints, this chapter briefly covers the most immediate concerns in the health insurance industry and provides
insight into how blockchain technology integration can contribute to resolving these issues. This chapter finishes by highlighting existing limitations as well as
potential future directions."
Blockchain-based covid vaccination registration and monitoring.,2022,journal,"Nabil, S. S., Pran, M. S. A., Haque, A. A. A., Chakraborty, N. R., Chowdhury, M. J. M. and Ferdous, M. S.","Blockchain: Research and Applications, 3 (4)(Q1)",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096720922000331,"COVID-19 has changed almost all aspects of our lives. Governments around the world have imposed lockdowns to slow down the transmissions. Fortunately, we have found the vaccine, in fact, a good number of them. However, managing the testing and vaccination process of the total population is a mammoth job. However, there are always delays or data silo problems in multi-organizational work. Therefore, streamlining this process is vital to improve efficiency and save more lives. Because of its effective data sharing mechanism among different entities with a number of security features, blockchain can be an effective tool for different applications in the health sector. Furthermore, blockchain provides a distributed system along with greater privacy, transparency, and authenticity. In this article, we have presented a blockchain-based system that seamlessly integrates testing and vaccination systems, allowing the system to be transparent. The instant verification of any tamper-proof COVID-19 test result has been developed, which will serve as “Test Certificates”. A transparent and efficient vaccination system has also been exhibited and implemented as the “Digital Vaccine Passport” (DVP) system. The infection rate-based prioritization will ensure a transparent and fair vaccination process as well as tackle the distribution issue of the limited amount of vaccine. The comparative review with other existing works is also discussed, highlighting a clear difference from the existing works. Our proposed system is distinctive on the basis of prioritization of vaccines and seamless integration of test certificates and vaccine passports, which will aid in controlling the pandemic situation. This system will also be handy in the case of tackling any future pandemics initially."

These data can provide valuable insights for medical researchers and clinicians that cannot be availed through traditional measures. Researchers have historically relied on survey responses or observed behavior. Interestingly, physiological data can provide a richer amount of user cognition than that obtained from any other sources, including the user himself. Therefore, the inexpensive consumer-grade wearable devices have become a point of interest for the health researchers. In addition, they are also used in continuous remote health monitoring and sometimes by the insurance companies. However, the biggest concern for such kind of use cases is the privacy of the individuals. A few privacy mechanisms, such as abstraction and k-anonymity, are widely used in information systems. Recently, differential privacy (DP) has emerged as a proficient technique to publish privacy sensitive data, including data from wearable devices. In this paper, we have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify, select and critically appraise researches in DP as well as to understand different techniques and exiting use of DP in wearable data publishing. Based on our study, we have identified the limitations of proposed solutions and provided future directions."

However, devising a Healthcare DT model for patient care is seen as a challenging task as the lack of adequate data collection structure. There are also security and privacy concerns as healthcare data is very sensitive and can be used in malicious ways. Because of these current research gaps, the proper way of acquiring the structured data and managing them in a secure way is very important. In this article, we present a mathematical data model to accumulate the patient relevant data in a structured and predefined way with proper delineation. Additionally, the provided data model is described in harmony with real life contexts. Then, we have used the patient centric mathematical data model to formally define the semantic and scope of our proposed Healthcare Digital Twin ( HDT ) system based on Blockchain. Accordingly, the proposed system is described with all the key components as well as with detailed protocol flows and an analysis of its different aspects.

These enterprise applications must meet several important criteria, including scalability, performance, and privacy. Enterprise blockchain applications are frequently constructed on private blockchain platforms to satisfy these criteria. Hyperledger Fabric is one of the most popular platforms within this domain. In any privacy blockchain system, including Fabric, every organisation needs to utilise a peer node (or peer nodes) to connect to the blockchain platform. Due to the ever-increasing size of blockchain and the need to support a large user base, the monitoring and the management of different resources of such peer nodes can be crucial for a successful deployment of such blockchain platforms. Unfortunately, little attention has been paid to this issue. In this work, we propose the first-ever solution to this significant problem by proposing an intelligent control system based on reinforcement learning for distributing the resources of Hyperledger Fabric. We present the architecture, discuss the protocol flows, outline the data collection methods, analyse the results and consider the potential applications of the proposed approach."

Though blockchain platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen immense success and acceptability, their nature of being public and anonymous makes them unsuitable for many enterprise-level use-cases. To address this issue, Linux Foundation has started an open-source umbrella initiative, known as the Hyperledger Platforms . Under this initiative, a number of private blockchain platforms have been developed. However, the scalability and performance of these private blockchains must be examined to understand their suitability for different use cases. Recent researches and projects on performance benchmarking for private blockchain systems are specific to use cases and generally tied to a blockchain platform. In this article, we present BlockMeter , an application-agnostic performance benchmarking framework for private blockchain platforms. BlockMeter can be utilised to measure the key performance metrics of any application deployed on top of an external private blockchain application in real-time. In this article, we present the architecture of the framework and discuss its different implementation aspects. Then, to showcase the applicability of the framework, we use BlockMeter to evaluate the two most widely used Hyperledger platforms, Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Sawtooth, against a number of use-cases."

In order to facilitate the management of user identities, the concept of identity management has been introduced. Various systems and protocols have been developed to manage online identities. However, these systems are provider-centric, focusing on aiding providers in managing their user bases. As a result, users often have limited control over their identity data and remain unaware of how centralized identity providers use or potentially misuse their data. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) has emerged as a new paradigm in the digital identity management landscape, aiming to empower users by allowing them greater control over their identity data. Although SSI is a relatively new domain, there have been numerous efforts, primarily from the industry, to introduce SSI standards, protocols, and systems, with multiple options in each category. Researchers eager to contribute to the SSI domain might find it challenging to understand the interconnections among these components. Notably, the SSI domain faces several challenges, as highlighted in various research works. These challenges must be addressed before SSI can achieve widespread adoption. This article presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of SSI, offers a detailed taxonomy, and identifies and analyzes the open challenges in SSI."

In order to distinguish between human users and bots, the Completely Automatic Public Turing Test (CAPTCHA) has been used for almost 20 years. Nevertheless, CAPTCHA can be easily broken if it lacks security features. Consequently, the motivation for utilizing CAPTCHA is undermined. This article proposes a framework that can evaluate the security aspects of text CAPTCHAs. The effectiveness of the framework is validated by using a generalized attack method consisting of pre-processing and utilizing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library such as Tesseract OCR. We have carried out a systematic study of existing CAPTCHAs utilized on Bangladeshi websites. We have studied 238 Bangladeshi websites and found that only 44 websites used a CAPTCHA mechanism. Then, we have assessed the security levels of the selected text CAPTCHAs by the proposed framework. As per our analysis, we have found that there are 29 different CAPTCHA schemes being adopted on Bangladeshi websites and among them 23 are vulnerable to automated attacks. In order to address these issues, we also present a number of recommendations."
